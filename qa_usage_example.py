üìä 1. BASIC USAGE (replace your existing calls):

OLD way:
    df = extract_melt_season_data_yearly(2020, 2023)

NEW way with advanced QA:
    # Standard advanced filtering (recommended)
    df = extract_melt_season_data_yearly(
        2020, 2023, 
        use_advanced_qa=True, 
        qa_level='standard'
    )
    
    # Strict filtering (highest quality)
    df = extract_melt_season_data_yearly(
        2020, 2023, 
        use_advanced_qa=True, 
        qa_level='strict'
    )

üéØ 2. WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

For melt season analysis:
    results = run_melt_season_analysis_williamson(
        start_year=2020,
        end_year=2023,
        use_advanced_qa=True,    # Enable advanced filtering
        qa_level='standard'      # Quality level

‚öôÔ∏è 3. QUALITY LEVELS EXPLAINED:

'strict':
  - Basic QA = 0 (best quality only)
  - All Algorithm flags filtered
  - Highest quality, fewer observations
  - Use for: Final analyses, publications

'standard':
  - Basic QA ‚â§ 1 (best + good quality)
  - Critical flags filtered (water, clouds, low signal)
  - Balanced quality/quantity
  - Use for: Most analyses (RECOMMENDED)

'relaxed':
  - Basic QA ‚â§ 2 (best + good + ok quality)
  - Minimal Algorithm flag filtering
  - Maximum data coverage
  - Use for: Exploratory analysis
""")

    print("""
üîç 4. ALGORITHM FLAGS FILTERED:

Bit 0 - Inland Water:     Always excluded (critical)
Bit 1 - Low Visible:      Always excluded (detection issue)
Bit 2 - Low NDSI:         Always excluded (weak snow signal)
Bit 3 - Temperature/Height: Excluded in 'strict' only
Bit 5 - Probable Cloud:   Always excluded (contamination)
Bits 4,6,7:              Available for future customization

üìà 5. EXPECTED BENEFITS:

Statistical Robustness:
  ‚úÖ More reliable Mann-Kendall trend tests
  ‚úÖ Better Sen's slope estimates
  ‚úÖ Reduced false positive/negative trends

Scientific Validity:
  ‚úÖ Follows Williamson & Menounos (2021) standards
  ‚úÖ Improved peer review acceptance
  ‚úÖ Better reproducibility

Data Quality:
  ‚úÖ Excludes contaminated pixels (water, clouds)
  ‚úÖ Removes low-confidence detections
  ‚úÖ Maintains temporal coverage

üöÄ 6. QUICK START RECOMMENDATION:

1. Start with 'standard' advanced QA for most work
2. Compare with your existing results
3. Use 'strict' for final publication-quality analyses
4. Document your QA approach in methodology sections

Example command to test:
    df = extract_melt_season_data_yearly(
        2023, 2023,  # Single year for testing
        use_advanced_qa=True,
        qa_level='standard'
    )
